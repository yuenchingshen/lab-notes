# Results
In this section write the verbatim results (eg. copy the code chunks, error reports, plots) that relate to the goals you have achieved this week.

example: 
This week I created a lab notebook repo using this method (include the cli arguments and the process below)
 
# Discussion
In this section explain your results and how they relate to you goals 

example:
I am applying for credit this quarter. Therefore, I chose to create a lab notebook repo in github to continue practicing git and github as it is an important tool for biotech/bioinformatics.

In this section add anything else you may wish to include.

example:
Nothing additional to comment this week. Work has been taken allot of my time this week. It's finals, I was not able to complete the goals I thought I would. I got a new hamster and it is very fluffy.
